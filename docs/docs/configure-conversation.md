Create a `chat.yml` file with your configuration before starting the web service.

Below is an example of configuration using the Llama 2 7B GGML model, without vectorstore, to deploy a **generic conversational chatbot**

```yaml title="chat.yml"
llm:
  model_type: llama
  model_path: ./models/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q3_K_L.bin # (1)
  model_download: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q3_K_L.bin
  temperature: 0.01    # Config how creative, but also potentially wrong, the model can be. 0 is safe, 1 is adventurous
  max_new_tokens: 1024 # Max number of words the LLM can generate

prompt:
  # Always use input for the human input variable with a generic agent
  variables: [input, history]
